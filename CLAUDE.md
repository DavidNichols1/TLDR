# Ketchup: notes for Claude sessions

Hackathon app (Meta Global AI Developer Hackathon, due Nov 4, 2026 9 PM ET). Product context
lives in the Brain vault note `Projects/Meta Hackathon/Meta Hackathon.md`; this file is
the technical recipe. README.md is the judge-facing overview.

## Rules
- The app was called TL;DR until Nov 2, 2026, then renamed Ketchup (as in *catch up*). On purpose,
  three things kept the old name: the `tldr` JSON field (stored data), the seed accounts'
  `tldr.demo+…` emails (live users), and the comments in applied migrations.
- No em dashes in anything user-facing: UI copy, Muse Spark output (brief.ts `plain()` strips
  them), docs.
- The repo is **public**. No secrets, ever: the Meta key is only the Supabase secret
  `META_API_KEY`; the service-role/secret key is only in the gitignored
  `scripts/seed-demo/.env`. The app ships only the publishable key (Config.swift).
- Must genuinely use the Meta Model API (Muse Spark). Don't swap in another model.
- Commit and push small, often: the history shows the work happened during the event.

## Backend (Supabase ref `cfqlnthmqwkhjbhylvgu`, still named "TLDR" in the dashboard)
- Migrations in `supabase/migrations/` are also applied live (Supabase MCP
  `apply_migration`); keep both in step. RLS is the security boundary.
- RLS tests: run `supabase/tests/rls_check.sql` via `execute_sql` (rolls back; expect all checks pass).
- Deploy the edge function without Docker:
  `supabase functions deploy catch-up --project-ref cfqlnthmqwkhjbhylvgu --use-api`
  (verify_jwt stays on). Check with `list_edge_functions` → `verify_jwt: true`, and an
  unauthenticated POST must return 401.
- Muse Spark: `supabase/functions/_shared/muse.ts`, `POST https://api.meta.ai/v1/chat/completions`,
  model `muse-spark-1.3` (override with `META_MODEL`), docs at https://dev.meta.ai/docs.
- Logs for a catch-up call: Supabase MCP `query_logs`, source `function_logs`; each Muse call
  logs `{mode, attempt, messages, prompt, completion, reasoning}` token counts. Latency is in
  `ai_briefs.latency_ms`. Keep `META_REASONING=low` (minimal invented a plan time on Nov 2).
- The app prefetches a catch-up when a chat opens with 15+ unread (ChatModel.open); the read
  cursor moves only when the user opens the result.
- Check secrets by name only: `supabase secrets list --project-ref cfqlnthmqwkhjbhylvgu`
  (run it from the repo root; it writes a `supabase/.temp` cache that is gitignored there).
- `enforce_message_hygiene` forces `messages.created_at = now()` on insert; the seed
  backdates with an update afterwards.

## iOS (`ios/Ketchup.xcodeproj`, scheme `Ketchup`, bundle `com.vibetemp.ketchup`, team GBXTAWLQK5)
- Build into default DerivedData (never under ~/Desktop):
  `cd ios && xcodebuild -project Ketchup.xcodeproj -scheme Ketchup -destination 'id=<sim udid>' build`
  (`xcrun simctl list devices available` for the udid; the iPhone 17 Pro sim works).
- Then the iOS Simulator MCP: `launch` with the built `Ketchup.app`, `screenshot`.
- David signs in himself (email + 8-digit code; `Config.otpLength` must match Auth → Email OTP Length); never type his email or codes.
- Sign-in needs `{{ .Token }}` in the Magic Link and Confirm signup email templates (set Nov 2, 2026). Email goes out through Resend SMTP from noreply@vibetemp.com (30/hour cap).

## Demo seed
`scripts/seed-demo/README.md`. 302-message "Breck Weekend 🎿" chat from 5 test accounts;
the viewer sets display name **David**, joins with the printed invite code, and has
302 unread. `--rearm` resets David to all-unread between video takes.

## Instagram catch-up (experimental, not released)
Code: `ios/Ketchup/Instagram/` (web view, `InstagramThreadReader.js`, result view), edge
function `catch-up-text`, migration `0004_text_brief_usage`. The only call site outside that
folder is `InstagramToolbarItem()` in `Views/ChatsListView.swift`. README has the summary.
- Rules: read only the DM thread the user has open, only on tap. Never inject scripts, read
  cookies or run anything on login pages. Store nothing: no `ai_briefs` rows, and no message
  text, names or model output in logs (counts and token usage only). Real tests use a separate
  test Instagram account with a staged chat, and David signs in himself. DOM dumps or
  screenshots with real DMs stay in the session scratchpad, never in git or reports.
- Offline: `deno test supabase/functions/_shared/` (transcript format, index refs), then the
  reader against the synthetic fixture (real WebKit, no network):
  `swift scripts/ig-extractor-check/check.swift --html ios/Ketchup/Instagram/Fixture/ig-thread-fixture.html --js ios/Ketchup/Instagram/InstagramThreadReader.js --expected ios/Ketchup/Instagram/Fixture/ig-thread-fixture.expected.json`
  must print `PASS 88/88` (about 6 s; exit 1 = a mismatch, 2 = the reader failed). Then the
  same against `ig-thread-fixture-virtual.html` and its `.expected.json` (the real page's
  structure: column-reverse scroller, virtualized rows), once as is and once with
  `--url 'https://www.instagram.com/direct/t/ketchup-test-fixture/?anchoring=on'`; all three
  must pass 88/88. Change a fixture and its `.expected.json` together.
- Deploy: `supabase functions deploy catch-up-text --project-ref cfqlnthmqwkhjbhylvgu --use-api`,
  and redeploy `catch-up` after any `_shared` change. `list_edge_functions` → `verify_jwt: true`
  on both; an unauthenticated POST to each must return 401. The RLS suite covers the cap.
- Simulator (Debug build, signed in to Ketchup): inbox toolbar camera button → `…` menu →
  "Test thread (fixture)" → "Catch me up on this chat". Launching with
  `-KetchupInstagramFixture YES` opens the fixture instead of instagram.com. The Xcode console
  prints counts only: `[instagram] read N messages, …`.
- On David's phone: `xcrun devicectl list devices` for the udid, build with
  `-destination 'id=<udid>' -allowProvisioningUpdates`, then
  `xcrun devicectl device install app --device <udid> <DerivedData>/Build/Products/Debug-iphoneos/Ketchup.app`.
  Real runs (Nov 3, 2026, David's account): before the virtualization fix about 31 messages
  with every sender shown as the group's name; after it, real names, and "Last 120" returns
  exactly 120 (found 122, stop "enough", 6 loads, 56 steps, 9 s of reading). The log line's
  `reader` object explains a short count: `stop` says why it ended, `units` vs `found` shows
  pieces that weren't messages, `dupes` shows rows read twice.
- Live check: `query_logs`, source `function_logs`, lines with `"fn":"catch-up-text"` carry
  `{source, mode, attempt, messages, prompt, completion, reasoning}` and nothing else. Usage:
  `select mode, message_count, created_at from text_brief_usage order by created_at desc limit 5`.
